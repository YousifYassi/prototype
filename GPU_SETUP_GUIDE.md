# GPU Setup Guide for Your System

## Your Hardware (Excellent for Deep Learning!)

- **CPU**: Intel Core i9-13980HX (24 cores, 32 threads)
- **RAM**: 32 GB
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop (4 GB VRAM)

Your RTX 4060 is **perfect for training** this model and will provide **10-30x speedup** compared to CPU!

## Current Status

❌ PyTorch is installed **without CUDA support** (CPU-only version)
- Current version: PyTorch 2.8.0+cpu
- Training currently runs on CPU only

---

## How to Enable GPU Training

### Option 1: Install PyTorch with CUDA (Recommended)

**Step 1**: Uninstall current PyTorch
```bash
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
```

**Step 2**: Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.1
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

*Alternative: If you have older CUDA drivers, use CUDA 11.8*
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

**Step 3**: Verify GPU is detected
```bash
python check_gpu.py
```

**Step 4**: Train with GPU
```bash
python train.py
```

### Option 2: Continue Using CPU

If you prefer to stick with CPU training (slower but works):

1. Open `config.yaml`
2. Change these settings:
   ```yaml
   training:
     batch_size: 2
     num_epochs: 5-10
     num_workers: 0
     device: "cpu"
   ```

---

## Updated Configuration

Your `config.yaml` has been updated with **optimized settings for your RTX 4060**:

### GPU Settings (After installing CUDA):
- `batch_size: 4` - Uses 4GB VRAM efficiently
- `num_epochs: 30` - Enough for good convergence
- `num_workers: 4` - Leverages your CPU for data loading
- `device: "cuda"` - Uses GPU

### Performance Comparison:

| Setup | Training Speed | Epoch Time | Total (30 epochs) |
|-------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| CPU (current) | ~3 FPS | ~2.5 min | ~75 minutes |
| GPU (RTX 4060) | ~30-100 FPS | ~15-30 sec | ~7.5-15 minutes |

**GPU is 5-10x faster!**

## Memory Considerations (4GB VRAM)

Your RTX 4060 has 4GB VRAM. Here's how to optimize:

### If you get "Out of Memory" errors:

1. **Reduce batch size**:
   ```yaml
   batch_size: 2  # or even 1
   ```

2. **Reduce frames**:
   ```yaml
   num_frames: 8  # instead of 16
   ```

3. **Use smaller backbone**:
   ```yaml
   backbone: "resnet18"  # instead of resnet50
   ```

4. **Mixed precision training** (automatically helps):
   PyTorch 2.8 enables this by default

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check GPU status
python check_gpu.py

# Verify system
python demo.py --check

# Train with GPU (after CUDA installation)
python train.py

# Monitor GPU usage during training (in another terminal)
nvidia-smi -l 1

# Run inference with GPU
python inference.py --model checkpoints/best_model.pth --source test_video.mp4
```

---

## Expected Results with GPU

Based on your hardware, after installing CUDA:

- **Training Time**: 7-15 minutes for 30 epochs (vs 75 min on CPU)
- **Inference Speed**: 30-60 FPS (vs 3 FPS on CPU)
- **Memory Usage**: ~2-3 GB VRAM (out of 4 GB available)
- **Accuracy**: Same as CPU, but you can train longer for better results!

## Troubleshooting

### CUDA installation fails?
- Make sure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers
- Visit: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
- Select: Stable, Windows, Pip, Python, CUDA 12.1

### GPU not detected after installation?
```bash
# Check NVIDIA driver
nvidia-smi

# Reinstall PyTorch
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
pip cache purge
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

### Out of memory during training?
- Reduce batch_size to 2 or 1
- Reduce num_frames to 8
- Close other GPU applications
- Monitor with `nvidia-smi`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Configuration updated for your RTX 4060
2. ⏳ Install PyTorch with CUDA support (optional but recommended)
3. ⏳ Run `python check_gpu.py` to verify
4. ⏳ Retrain model with GPU for better results
5. ⏳ Enjoy 10-30x faster training!
