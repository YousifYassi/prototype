# Training Configuration
# RECOMMENDED: Install PyTorch with CUDA to use your RTX 4060 GPU (10-30x faster!)
# Run: pip uninstall torch torchvision && pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
training:
  # GPU Settings (RTX 4060 with 4GB VRAM) - Uncomment when CUDA is installed
  batch_size: 4          # Increase to 4-6 for GPU (currently 2 for CPU)
  num_epochs: 30         # Increase to 30-50 for GPU (currently 5 for quick CPU test)
  num_workers: 4         # Increase to 4-6 for GPU (currently 0 for CPU)
  device: "cuda"         # Use "cuda" for GPU, "cpu" for CPU-only
  
  # CPU Settings (if not using GPU) - Use these values:
  # batch_size: 2
  # num_epochs: 5-10
  # num_workers: 0
  # device: "cpu"
